  # HTML Semantic Refactor

  ## Description
  This is a website about the company Horiseon and what benefits they have to offer. I was tasked with refactoring these files to improve accessibility and semantics. I changed all the divs to proper semantic format. Changed the title to better reflect the site. Consolidated CSS classes that were doing the same things.
