# Activity-1-Homework

This is a website about the company Horiseon and what benefits they have to offer. I was tasked with refactoring these files to improve accessibility and semantics. I changed all the divs to proper semantic format. Changed the title to better reflect the site. Consolidated CSS classes that were doing the same things. Added alts to all the imgs. Added a README with screenshot and link to deployed application.
